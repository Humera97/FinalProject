# Project: Tweets vs Movie Reviews about Hala Movie
Hala is a movie about a Muslim teenager that's been largely praised by movie critics. However, many people on Twitter- many of whom are part of the Muslim community (unlike most of the moview critics) have had a negative reaction. I think it would be interesting to compare the two reactions.

## Data Source: Twitter API and GDELT
Both of these data sources exist, and I have applied to get access to the Twitter Developer API. I have access to GDELT, but it's a little hard to understand how to use it, and I wll be figuring that out later (thanks Aseem!)

## Who is in my group: Me, I am in my group

## Data Visualization
I have a few different data visuals in mind, although I am not sure the final product will include all of my idea. I'm hoping my overall story will be a responsive project with Scrollytelling and elements of interactivy dispersed throughout.
